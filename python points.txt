1. Notice that the %s token is replaced by whatever I pass to the string after the % symbol.

"Hello %s, my name is %s" % ('john', 'mike') # Hello john, my name is mike".
If you are using ints instead of string, use %d instead of %s.

name = raw_input("who are you?")
print "hello %s" % (name,)

2.
isinstance(variable, datatype) : checks whether variable is of the mentioned datatype
if isinstance(myint, int) and myint == 20:
    print("Integer: %d" % myint)

3.
Using two multiplication symbols makes a power relationship.
squared = 7 ** 2
cubed = 2 ** 3

Python also supports multiplying strings to form a string with a repeating sequence:
lotsofhellos = "hello " * 10
print(lotsofhellos)


Just as in strings, Python supports forming new lists with a repeating sequence using the multiplication operator:
print([1,2,3] * 3)

This is extended slice syntax. The general form is [start:stop:step].
